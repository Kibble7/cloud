## Benefits of High Availability and Scalability in the Cloud

### High Availability (HA)  
- **Definition:** Ensures applications and services are continuously operational with minimal downtime.  
- **Goal:** Reduce single points of failure.  
- **Methods:**  
  - Redundant hardware/VMs  
  - Load balancing  
  - Azure Availability Zones and Sets  

### Fault Tolerance  
- **Definition:** The ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of a component failure.  
- **Key Concept:** No service interruption despite hardware/software failures.  
- **Examples in Azure:**  
  - Geo-redundant storage (GRS)  
  - Azure Load Balancer with backend redundancy  

### Disaster Recovery (DR)  
- **Definition:** Strategies and services for restoring operations after a major failure (e.g., natural disaster, cyberattack).  
- **Focus:** Backup, restore, and failover.  
- **Azure Services:**  
  - Azure Site Recovery (ASR)  
  - Azure Backup  
- **RTO:** Max acceptable downtime  
- **RPO:** How much data loss is acceptable  

### Scalability  
- **Definition:** The ability to increase or decrease resources based on demand.  
- **Types:**  
  - Vertical (scale up): Add more power (CPU, RAM) to a single machine.  
  - Horizontal (scale out): Add more machines or instances.  
- **Azure Example:** Azure App Service auto-scaling  

### Elasticity  
- **Definition:** Automatic scaling of resources based on real-time demand (dynamically).  
- **Dynamic:** Grows and shrinks without manual intervention.  
- **Example:** Automatically add more VMs during high traffic, then remove them afterward.  

### Agility (fast and flexible)  
- Ability to quickly deploy and change resources to meet new business needs or changes.  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Faster time to market  
  - Easier experimentation and innovation  
- **Azure Example:** Use of DevOps and ARM templates to deploy resources quickly
